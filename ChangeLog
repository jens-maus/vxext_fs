  * misc: updated the sources to compile with linux kernels 
    of version 3.11.0

2012-06-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: updated the sources to compile with linux kernels 
    of version 3.2.0

2012-04-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: updated the sources to compile with linux kernels 
    of version 3.0.0

2010-05-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: updated the sources to compile with linux kernels 
    of version 2.6.32

2009-11-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: updated the sources to compile with linux kernels 
    of version 2.6.31

2009-04-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: updated the sources to compile with linux kernels 
    of version 2.6.28

2009-04-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * inode.c: fixed a bug in the sec_per_clus calculation by
    extracting the value from a reserved area of the boot sector
    instead of calculating it dynamically.

2009-03-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: bumped version to 2.0 as this is a complete rewrite
    from scratch.
  * misc: rewritten the whole file system driver from scratch
    and adapted it to the very latest FAT/MSDOS sources found
    in kernel 2.6.27.11+. Now any further porting should be a
    bit easier because the new implementation uses more or
    less the original FAT/MSDOS sources of the Linux kernel
    with only minor changes applied.

2008-10-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: bumped version to 1.3 for release
  * inode.c: removed the sectors/track and heads check as these
    are values a VXEXT1.0 file system does not care about.

2007-11-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * inode.c: fixed the sectors/cluster calculation so that in
    case a VXEXT1.0 filesystem has got a valid sectors/cluster
    field, we are still able to access the filesystem structure.

2007-10-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: bumped version to 1.2 due to large changes.
  * misc: adapted sources to latest linux kernel changes which
    rendered our vxext driver incompatible to kernel 2.6.23+

2007-04-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: bumped version to 1.1 due to large changes.
  * misc: adapted sources to latest linux kernel changes. vxext
    should now be compatible with kernel versions 2.6.18+. Also
    the build environment should now properly compile the module
    without having to merge the changes into the kernel sources.

2005-03-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefile: added main Makefile which can be used to compile
    the kernel module without having to patch the whole kernel
    tree.
  * misc: updated copyright to 2005

2004-08-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * first import of the VxWorks extended DOS filesystem
    implementation for linux 2.6.7
