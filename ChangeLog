  * inode.c: fixed the sectors/cluster calculation so that in
    case a VXEXT1.0 filesystem has got a valid sectors/cluster
    field, we are still able to access the filesystem structure.

  * misc: bumped version to 1.2 due to large changes.
  * misc: adapted sources to latest linux kernel changes which
    rendered our vxext driver incompatible to kernel 2.6.23+

  * misc: bumped version to 1.1 due to large changes.
  * misc: adapted sources to latest linux kernel changes. vxext
    should now be compatible with kernel versions 2.6.18+. Also
    the build environment should now properly compile the module
    without having to merge the changes into the kernel sources.

2005-03-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefile: added main Makefile which can be used to compile
    the kernel module without having to patch the whole kernel
    tree.
  * misc: updated copyright to 2005

2004-08-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * first import of the VxWorks extended DOS filesystem
    implementation for linux 2.6.7
