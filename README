ABOUT
---------------------------
The files you find in this directory are part of a reverse engineered 
implementation of the so called VXEXT1.0 extended DOS filesystem shipped and
used in the VxWorks Real-Time Operating System developed by Wind River, Inc.

Sources and development of this filesystem is largly based on the standard
FAT and MSDOS filesystem routines found as part of the main linux kernel
sources which are copyright by their respecitive authors mentioned there.
However, minor cosmetic changes have been made to the sources and non required
parts were removed wherever possible, making the sources easier to maintain.

AUTHOR
----------------------------
Development started in July 2004 and a first 1.0 version was published in
early August 2004. The current author is:

Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

COMMENTS
-----------------------------
Please note that as this is a totally reverse engineered filesystem driver based
on the results of an VxWorks 5.2 system no warranty can be given that it might
also work with later versions of VxWorks or any other brand of the VxWorks RTOS.
Absolutly no documentation or official help from Wind River Inc was received 
during the development of this implementation. So the implementation is only
based on the research done during development but using disk analyzing tools and
such. So if you have any detailed official information about the exact implementation
of this filesystem you can share, please feel free to contact me.

MORE INFORMATION
------------------------------
Please consult the linux based vxext.txt filesystem documentation included in the
driver for a more detailed information on the particular implemenation.
