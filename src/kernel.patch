+config VXEXT_FS
+        tristate "VxWorks extended DOS fs support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
+	help
+	  The Real-Time Operating System VxWorks v5+ normally ships with an own
+	  FAT16 based DOS filesystem implementation that can work either in a
+	  compatibility mode or in a so-called "extended DOS" (VXEXT1.0) mode.
+	  
+	  While in compatibility mode the normal MSDOS filesystem can be used
+	  and therefore comes with all restrictions like 8+3 and a maximum of
+	  2GB on a partition, running the dosFS part of VxWorks in the
+	  extended version allows to have filenames of up to 40 characters length
+	  and allows to store more than a total of 2GB on a single partition.
+
+	  However, this makes it of course incompatible to the standard FAT16
+	  filesystem as it comes with some specialities for which this separate
+	  implementation is responsible for.
+
+	  So if you want to directly access "extended DOS" VxWorks partitions,
+	  you can select to compile the VXEXT file system support either as a
+	  module (M), or directly into the kernel.
+
+	  Please note that especially write support is highly considered
+	  experimental.
+
+	  So if you haven't heard about all of this before, it's safe to say N.
+
+	  For more information, please consult
+	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/vxext-fs.txt>.
